        "# Problem Statement:-\n",
        "  ##### In a rabit leap problem, three east-bound rabbits stand in a line blocked by three west-bound rabbits. They are crossing a stream with stones placed in the east wesst direction in a line. There is one empty stone between them. The rabbits can only move forward one or two steps. They can jump over one rabbit if the need arises, but not more than that. Are they smart enough to cross each other without having to step into the water.\n",
